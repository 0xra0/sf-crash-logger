# CrashLogger

An [SFSE](https://sfse.silverlock.org/) plugin for Starfield that captures crashes with detailed reports: stack traces, register dumps, RTTI object identification, and minidumps.

## Features

- **Exception handler** installed at preload — catches crashes from all plugins, not just ones that load after us
- **Early-warning breadcrumb trace** — a continuously-appended, crash-durable log (`CrashLogger_trace.log`) of first-chance exceptions and lifecycle markers written *before* the crash. Uses raw `WriteFile` (survives `TerminateProcess`, unlike a buffered stream) and an allocation-free path (works on a corrupted heap), so it leaves evidence even for the crashes that produce **no `.dmp` and no crash log** — stack overflows, fail-fast/heap-corruption trips, and hard kills. The last breadcrumbs are also embedded in each crash report
- **Termination / fail-fast backstop** — IAT hooks on `RaiseFailFastException`, self-`TerminateProcess`, and `std::terminate` capture a stack and emit a full `.log`+`.dmp` for abnormal exits that bypass the normal SEH filter. (A raw compiler `__fastfail`/`int 29h` — a smashed `/GS` cookie or heap-manager corruption trip — still can't be caught in-process; for those the Wine/Proton log via `PROTON_LOG=1` is the source of truth.)
- **Fault analysis** — classifies the access violation and names the faulting module inline: near-null dereference + field offset, `-1`/sentinel pointer, and **debug-allocator poison patterns** (`0xCDCD…` uninitialized, `0xDDDD…`/`0xFEEE…` use-after-free, etc.). It also **ties the fault address back to a register** — `access via RCX+0x38 (field of RCX = 0xCDCD… — uninitialized heap)` — so the base pointer, the field offset, and the bug class are all read straight from the log
- **Culprit summary** — lists every SFSE plugin found anywhere on the stack, so "which mod was running" is answered without a debugger
- **Address Library IDs** — every game-executable address (fault site, stack frames, register targets) is also annotated with its Address Library ID (`ID: 449566+0x2A`), the stable identifier mod authors and other crash logs share, making crashes comparable across game versions and searchable. Reads `versionlib-<ver>.bin` from the plugins folder itself (both the delta-encoded v1/v2 and the direct v5 formats); if no database matching the running game version is present, IDs are simply omitted — nothing else changes
- **Stack trace** with symbol names and source locations (when PDB is present)
- **Stack scan** — linearly scans raw stack memory for return addresses and object pointers, recovering the deeper frames the strict frame-pointer unwinder drops in optimised engine code (no external tooling needed)
- **Register dump** (RAX–R15, RIP, EFLAGS) plus **register targets** — each register annotated with `module+offset` (code) or its RTTI type (live game object)
- **RTTI object identification** — resolves pointer-sized values to C++ type names via the game's RTTI metadata
- **Minidump** (`.dmp`) compatible with WinDbg / Visual Studio
- **Module list** with base addresses, sizes, and version strings; SFSE plugins flagged separately
- **Startup log** — appends a timestamped line to `CrashLogger.log` every game launch so you can confirm the plugin is active

All analysis runs inside the plugin at crash time — the `.log` is self-contained and readable without symbols, WinDbg, or any post-processing script.

## Crash log location

```
%USERPROFILE%\Documents\My Games\Starfield\SFSE\Crashlogs\
```

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `CrashLogger.log` | One line per game session — confirms the plugin loaded |
| `CrashLogger_trace.log` | Rolling early-warning trace (first-chance exceptions + lifecycle), flushed as it happens — the only survivor when a crash produces no dump. Rotated to `.old` past 4 MiB |
| `crash_<timestamp>.log` | Full crash report (exception, breadcrumbs, registers, stack, modules) |
| `crash_<timestamp>.dmp` | Minidump for debugger analysis |

## Installation

1. Install [SFSE](https://sfse.silverlock.org/).
2. Download `CrashLogger.dll` from [Releases](../../releases).
3. Place it in `<Starfield>\Data\SFSE\Plugins\`.
4. Launch the game through SFSE.

## Building from source

### Prerequisites

- xmake
- LLVM/Clang with `clang-cl` and `lld-link`
- [xwin](https://github.com/Jake-Shadle/xwin) (for Linux cross-compilation) **or** MSVC on Windows

### Build

```sh
xmake build
```

Output: `build/windows/x64/releasedbg/CrashLogger.dll`

> **Linux cross-compilation**: requires `clang-cl`, `llvm-lib`, `lld-link`, and the xwin Windows SDK at `~/.xwin/`. See the project wiki for the full setup guide.
